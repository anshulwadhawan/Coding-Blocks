A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

There are many stream objects provided by Node.js. For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

Streams can be readable, writable, or both. All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in Node.js. The stream module provides a base API that makes it easy to build objects that implement the stream interface.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

For instance, a request to an HTTP server and process.stdout are both stream instances.

All streams are instances of EventEmitter.
